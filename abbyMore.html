								<p>This movie was inspired by my real-life experience with someone. <br/>

                                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, I‚Äôve watched the Duplass brothers‚Äô This is John. It felt like a religious experience coming together. Not only did it got into Sundance, but it only cost them $3 to make. Genius, I should make one myself! But here‚Äôs the catch: I don‚Äôt have two people, to act and to move the camera, nor do I have $3. <br />
                                    
                                    So what was my plan? Since it's still in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Obviously I'm making the film by myself and budgeting it with only $0. Yes that was actually the plan.The filming process went on for about a week, the first day being the idea of making the film. That day, I instantly took my phone and recorded myself acting on something, I don't actually know what I was doing. The film‚Äôs story wasn‚Äôt really clear at this stage but it didn‚Äôt pull me back. The story went on from being shots of myself, to becoming a story about my life experience-ish. <br />
                                    
                                    By the post-production stage, I went on to research every single frame from the French new-wave movement (mostly Jean-Luc Godard, because somehow I got interested in it). I went crazy for the cropping and close-ups. <br />
                                    
                                    This was a truly great experience, just making the film by itself. It taught me a lot on how to handle different obstacles; and personally learning to improve more as a filmmaker. <br />
                                    
                                    ‚ÄúNo one can stop you from doing exactly what you want to do. If you can accept that the cavalry won't come, and if you can be the cavalry, it gives you a chance to be happy.‚Äù - Mark Duplass<br />
