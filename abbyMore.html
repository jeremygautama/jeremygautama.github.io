								<p>This movie was inspired by my real-life experience with someone. <br /> 

									<br />During the COVID-19 pandemic, I stumbled upon the Duplass brothers’ This is John. It felt like a religious experience coming together. Not only did it got into Sundance, but it only cost them $3 to make. I want to do that. But here’s the catch: I have no friends to help, nor do I have money to budget. <br />
									
									<br />So what was my plan? To make the film by myself and budgeting it with $0. <br />
									
									<br />The filming process went on for about a week, the first day being the idea of making the film. I don’t know what happened, but that exact day, I instantly took my phone and recorded myself acting on something. I don't actually know what I was doing, but that's okay (I thought to myself). The story went on from being shots of hollowness, to becoming a solid story. <br />
									
									<br />I think it's a nice side-project to fill up my boredom during these weird times.<br />
